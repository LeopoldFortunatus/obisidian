### Cannibal plains pt 2  
9)  
Description: This spot is great for a variety of reasons, you have TONS of iron, you've got copper, grow basically anything except riceweed, but I suspect the permanent rain here is just visual and won't actually feed your crops. You get 80% water here anyway, so no big deal. You even have some flat terrain. You're also close to World's End, Flotsam and Armour king, there's a road from you to right down the entrance to Wend. There's a solid cliff you can connect your walls to as well. Only trouble is you have to deal with 50-60% stone, it's not the best.  
  
### Foglands  
2  
Description: If there's any spot on this list you recognize actually it's probably this one, this spot is pretty legendary if only because it's one of the only locations people talk about when you do a web search for 'kenshi base locations'. And for good reason. You got all your resources, it's a nice plateau, easy to defend, you're neck-deep in fogmen so if the cannibals come calling you're safe, and it's very likely no other faction will ever bother you

Description: I was really impressed by the terrain here. Not only can you sort of get at the resources you need here, this immensely vertical mountaintop which is actually pathable and you can build on it, also is a fairly enclosed space that only has a couple of pathways into it!

### The Outlands

You may have some trouble with sort of being in the middle, almost, of like several different weirdo south-easterly groups that all want to fight each other, but hey, at least you're near Black Scratch and some other towns, surprisingly close to civilization despite being near the edge of the map.
